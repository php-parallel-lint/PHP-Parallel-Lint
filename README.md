This application checks syntax of PHP files in parallel.
It can output in plain text, colored text, json and checksyntax formats.
Additionally `blame` can be used to show commits that introduced the breakage.

Running parallel jobs in PHP is inspired by Nette framework tests.

The application is officially supported for use with PHP 5.4 to 8.0.

## Installation

Install with `composer` as development dependency:

    composer require --dev php-parallel-lint/php-parallel-lint

Alternatively you can install as a standalone `composer` project:

    composer create-project php-parallel-lint/php-parallel-lint /path/to/folder/php-parallel-lint
    /path/to/folder/php-parallel-lint/parallel-lint # running tool

For colored output, install the suggested package `php-parallel-lint/php-console-highlighter`:

    composer require --dev php-parallel-lint/php-console-highlighter

## Example output

## History

This project was originally created by [@JakubOnderka] and released as
[jakub-onderka/php-parallel-lint].

Since then, Jakub has moved on to other interests and as of January 2020, the
second most active maintainer [@grogy] has taken over maintenance of the project
and given the project - and related dependencies - a new home in the PHP
Parallel Lint organisation.

It is strongly recommended for existing users of the (unmaintained)
[jakub-onderka/php-parallel-lint] package to switch their dependency to
[php-parallel-lint/php-parallel-lint], see [How to upgrade](#how-to-upgrade) below.

## Recommended excludes for Symfony framework

To run from the command line:

    vendor/bin/parallel-lint --exclude app --exclude vendor .

## Create Phar package

PHP Parallel Lint supports [Box app](https://box-project.github.io/box2/) for creating Phar package. First, install box app:


    curl -LSs https://box-project.github.io/box2/installer.php | php


then run the build command in parallel lint folder, which creates `parallel-lint.phar` file.


    box build
